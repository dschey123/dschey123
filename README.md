👋 Hey there, I’m Dakota!
🧑‍💻 A proud Longhorn alum and recent NYU Stern grad with a passion for Data Science, Business Computing, and occasionally getting lost in the streets of NYC (still learning how to navigate them... help?).

💬 I’m always open to collaborating on anything data science-related! Have a wacky idea, cool startup, or the next big AI project? Let’s connect—no idea is too big, small, or weird.

📫 Reach me anytime at dakota.schey@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn.
