👋 Hey there, I’m Dakota!
🧑‍💻 A proud Longhorn alum and recent NYU Stern grad with a passion for Data Science, Business Computing, and occasionally getting lost in the streets of NYC (still learning how to navigate them... help?).

💡 Currently diving into smart contracts, blockchain, and other crypto wizardry (Uniswap fan here!), while also trying to master the ukulele—because hey, who said data scientists can’t jam?

🤖 My tech heart beats for AI, predictive modeling, and making data dance through machine learning projects. If it's about turning raw data into actionable insights, I'm in. From healthcare projects that help save lives (seriously cool stuff) to scraping the web for real-time crypto sentiment, I’m all about combining curiosity with code.

💼 When I'm not plotting new algorithms or building models, you can find me experimenting with NLP, working on sentiment analysis for medical data (healthcare has never been more predictive), and even dabbling in marketing analytics with a splash of A/B testing.

💬 I’m always open to collaborating on anything data science-related! Have a wacky idea, cool startup, or the next big AI project? Let’s connect—no idea is too big, small, or weird.

📫 Reach me anytime at dakota.schey@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn.
